* File Management

** Projectile

[[https://projectile.mx/][Projectile]] is a project management library for Emacs which makes it a lot easier to navigate around code projects for various languages.  Many packages integrate with Projectile so it's a good idea to have it installed even if you don't use its commands directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package projectile
        :diminish projectile-mode
        :config (projectile-mode)
        :custom ((projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
        :bind-keymap
        ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
        :init
        ;; NOTE: Set this to the folder where you keep your Git repos!
        (when (file-directory-p lukkadd/projects-folder)
          (setq projectile-project-search-path (list (symbol-value 'lukkadd/projects-folder))))
        (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'projectile-dired)
        :config
        (setq projectile-per-project-compilation-buffer t))

      (use-package counsel-projectile
        :after projectile
        :config (counsel-projectile-mode))

** Magit

[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is the best Git interface I've ever used.  Common Git operations are easy to execute quickly using Magit's command panel system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package magit
    :commands magit-status
    :custom
    (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1))

  ;; NOTE: Make sure to configure a GitHub token before using this package!
  ;; - https://magit.vc/manual/forge/Token-Creation.html#Token-Creation
  ;; - https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Getting-Started.html#Getting-Started
  (use-package forge
    :after magit)

#+end_src

** Dired

Dired is a built-in file manager for Emacs that does some pretty amazing things! 

*** Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package dired
    :ensure nil
    :commands (dired dired-jump)
    :bind (("C-x C-j" . dired-jump))
    :custom ((dired-listing-switches "-agho --group-directories-first")))

  (use-package all-the-icons-dired
    :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode))

  (use-package dired-open
    :commands (dired dired-jump)
    :config
    ;; Doesn't work as expected!
    ;;(add-to-list 'dired-open-functions #'dired-open-xdg t)
    (setq dired-open-extensions '(("png" . "feh")
                                  ("mkv" . "mpv"))))

  (use-package dired-hide-dotfiles
    :hook (dired-mode . dired-hide-dotfiles-mode)
    :config
    (evil-collection-define-key 'normal 'dired-mode-map
      "H" 'dired-hide-dotfiles-mode))
